This is a data analysis that I did for an interview for the Wharton Analytics Fellows. I had loan data and had to predict defaulting behavior of businesses based on macroeconomic data as well as a few metrics about business size, loan size, etc. Data was additionally supplemented by pulling from publicly available data on the [FRED](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/) database.

Random Forest classification algorithm achieved accuracy of 93.5% on testing data with AUC of 0.96. 

In my analysis, I found that the most important factors contributing to defaulting behavior were the length of the loan, as well as how long it took for the loan to be disbursed.
